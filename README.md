### Project Goal:

* Challenge the typical implementation of crafting in video games that relies on limited predetermined options and static outcomes.

### Approach:

* Develop a free form crafting mechanic that creates a totally unique piece of pixel art that can then be used in the game.
* Use image classification to give value to the created object based on aesthetic qualities, so that the creative process has meaning within the game.	

### Results:
* Greater player agency, creative freedom, and personal expression.
* Potential for more meaningful story telling that reacts to the playerâ€™s own creativity.
* Player-made game assets.

### How the image classification works:
* The profile of the object created is captured as a black and white image and classified as one of 4 categories:
  * Cup
  * Bowl
  * Decorative piece
  * Junk.
* The piece is also given a score based on how symmetrical the object is, allowing for variation in preferences within a given class.
* Each customer has their own neural net, trained on a unique data set and given a different preference for symmetry, simulating different opinions and tastes between people.

### Limitations:
* The Godot game engine is not optimized for running convolutional networks, so the models had to be tuned to be as simple as possible.
* All data was generated through gameplay by myself alone.
* All data was classified by myself alone.

For a larger or more developed project the data generation and classifcation process would need to involve a diverse selection of people to account for real diversity in preferences and aproaches to gameplay.

### Notes:
* Much of the game mechanics are salvaged from an older project that I was working on while still learning the basics of programming, and there is likely some large inconsistencies in code quality as a result.
* The integration of a Keras convolutional network into Godot was acomplished with an enormous amount of help from [this repository](https://github.com/postcode-x/godot-keras).
